# Myra's `dotfiles` Collection
## Author: Myra Roberts
### Current architecture: MacOS

This is the repo for storing my current `~/.dotfiles` folder. It's mean to be
used with GNU `stow`, usually the command

```sh
stow */
```

in `~/.dotfiles`. 

This is currently built with MacOS in mind (as that is my current daily
driver), and so has config for
[AeroSpace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace) as a stand-in for proper
TWM. 

If you want to use this, feel free to, though be aware that some of my config
(especially for things like `neovim`) is a wee bit chronically insane. 

You have been warned.
