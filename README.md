# Myra's `dotfiles` Collection
## Author: Myra Roberts
### Current architecture: Fedora 40

This is the repo for storing my current `dotfiles` folder. It's mean to bt used
with GNU `stow`, usually the command
```sh
stow */
```
in `~/dotfiles`. 

This is currently built with Fedora 40 in mind (as that is my current distro
of choice), however this may change in the future as I continue to listlessly
hop from distro to distro for funsies. It also has a few options to change 
things for whether it's on laptop or desktop (mostly in the `polybar` config).

If you want to use this, feel free to, though be aware that I am a little bit,
as they say professionally, "fucked up in the head" so some of my config 
(especially for things like `neovim`) is a wee bit chronically insane. 

You have been warned.
